# Prediction-of-Global-temperature-in-Canada---Germany
The main objective of our project is to analyze and predict the temperature increase since 1750 by using time series and regression model in different parts of the world and the effect of solar radiation based on various factors.

The global climate is becoming an increasingly pertinent world issue. Its effect has been felt everywhere.
For example, melting of glaciers, rise in a sea level, increase in the land surface temperature etc.
The climate change is a serious issue and affects mankind directly in different ways.

The dataset taken into consideration is a part of Global Temperature studies conducted independently by Berkley Earth and NASA. 
The processed data is sourced from Kaggle.com, this data is cleaned & loaded for analysis of Climate Changes (Surface Temperature) and Solar Radiation Levels.

There are 2 data sets used in our analysis.

Data set 1: Climate change: Average global earth surface temperature 
This dataset contains global average land temperature in Celsius since 1750 collected by Berkley Earth, categorized by country, major city, city and state.
Number of observations:2514086
Number of columns: 33


Data set 2: Prediction of Solar radiation Levels.
This data set contains the response parameter as Solar radiation such as Wind direction, wind speed, humidity and temperature. 
These parameters will be used to predict the Solar radiation levels. Data is collected by NASA
Number of rows: 32687
Number of columns: 11
